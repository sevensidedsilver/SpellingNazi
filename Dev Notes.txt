TEXTSCRAPER:
DRY up the code~






Some people list URLs in their twitter profiles descriptions
rather than in the profile URL space... consider adding functionality
to find these urls and add them to our object.


(missy's idea!) - 
using recursion, copy the first array and cycle through it,
popping the values to run the function on - keeping the original array, and adding to it if the indexof === -1
