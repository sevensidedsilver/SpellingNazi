Initial Intent Model and Development Approach:
Part 1. Scraper/collector - 
Build a node.js program that collects a large list of user website URLs listed on twitter accounts. Reduce the URLs to root domain and remove duplicates.

Part 2. Sorter
Build something to determine if the site is a portfolio/resume site or some other kind of site. At minimum this could be something to exclude sites from a big list of sites known to be webmastered or otherwise has spelling accounted for.

Part 3. Spellchecker
Use some API or existing program to spellcheck the text of the website. 

Part 4. Poster
Configure a bot to tweet any found spelling mistakes to the coorisponding twitter user.


========================================================================================

4/10/17 - I haven't written any code since the initial github commit. After reading something in "Javascript: The Good Parts", I have decided that I'll create an array of user websites as I planned before, but also create an object of the data. 

As of now, I feel stuck. I can't figure out how to pull a user listed website from a twitter account. I need to learn more about how to intigrate/use the Twitter API. There's an object property GET request built in for the user website - I just don't have it working for me yet.
